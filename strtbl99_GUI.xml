  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov02">The American fleet and Naval base were destroyed so quickly that your soldiers were able to capture several American officers.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov02">The American fleet was destroyed. While Soviet casualties were high, this is of no concern so long as you continue to bring victory.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov03">The Psychic Beacon was built so quickly that an entire American Armored division was captured by its power before they could escape.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov03">You have spread the power of Premier Romanov. American civilians are eagerly joining our army.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov04">The Korean invasion was repelled with such ferocity that some members of their government have spoken secretly to us of peace.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov04">In a long and bloody battle, you successfully defended mother Russia.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov05">The French fear your command more than they fear our tanks. In Paris you are known only as 'The Butcher'.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov05">You turned the Paris Tower into a weapon of terror. You have 'punished' Europe sufficiently.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov06">Allied Admirals now refuse to send their ships to sea, so quick was your destruction of Pearl Harbor.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov06">The Koreans and Americans have been successfully divided. The Pacific is ours.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov07">Your ruthless efficiency has earned you great respect in the Red Army and made Soviet leadership fear your popularity.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov07">The battle lab is safe. The Allies will not dare strike inside mother Russia again.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov08">Traitors beware: Your sudden and righteous attack on Washington D.C. has made your rivals fear your strategic skills.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov08">Vladimir has been punished for his crimes. Your victory has not gone unnoticed in this dark hour.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov09">World leaders tremble in fear at the mention of our psychic troops. With you in command, no one is safe.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov09">The President is ours to command. You will be rewarded for your zeal.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov10">Your strategic skills are becoming legendary. It is openly said among the men that it is you alone that will bring them victory.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov10">The Allies cannot hold out much longer against your heavy-handed assaults. You use the lives of your men well.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov11">Already your name is known to school children as the greatest general the world has ever known.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov11">Yuri's defenses were weak and feeble. Your tank divisions swept him aside as you have swept aside so many others.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov12">History will name you among the greatest commanders that has ever lived. Now the world is yours to rule.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov12">The Allies are beaten and the world is begging to be spared the carnage of your armed forces. Supreme power is yours alone.</v>

  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgAll01md">Your quick thinking caught both the Soviets and Yuri off guard. The Soviet invasion of San Francisco has been thwarted, and Yuri's plans have been thrown into disarray. Well done, Commander.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgAll01md">Though we have thwarted both the plans of the Soviets and Yuri, the population of San Francisco suffered terrible losses.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgAll04md">With your speed and accuracy Einstein was rescued and Yuri's installation is no more. Yuri realizes now you're a force to be reckoned with.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgAll04md">You rescued Einstein but Yuri was able to withdraw key forces before his base was destroyed.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgAll05md">Yuri's cloning facilities are now rubble thanks to your incredible tactics. Well done!</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgAll05md">You have destroyed Yuri's cloning facilities, but the long battle has left Sydney devastated.</v>

  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov04md">Premier Romanov has been rescued and safely evacuated but he is not happy. It took too long for you to rescue him.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleSov04md">Your rank is: Captain</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleSov05md">Your rank is: Major</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov06md">You moved so quickly that Yuri couldn't do anything but watch his lunar establishment crumble. The moon is now a part of the glorious Soviet state.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov06md">Yuri's lunar base has been destroyed. Congratulations, General.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleSov06md">Your rank is: Lieutenant Colonel</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleSov07md">Your rank is: Colonel</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgAll02md">Great job, Commander. Your quick actions minimized civilian losses in the city and denied Yuri an important source of income to fund his plans. Hollywood agents are already offering deals for the rights to your life story.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgAll02md">Yuri has lost an important source of funds, but not without exacting a heavy price on the civilian population of Los Angeles.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgAll03md">Yuri's plot to blackmail the city of Seattle has been thwarted. Your lightning-fast response prevented heavy losses to the population. Yuri will have to look elsewhere to fund his war effort.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgAll03md">Though Yuri has been driven from Seattle, the city paid a heavy price for your victory. Much of Seattle now lies in radioactive ruins, and the software market has been thrown into disarray.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgAll06md">Yuri never had a chance. The world leaders are safe and Yuri has been driven from London. Excellent work, General.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgAll06md">The day is won...but at what cost? The world leaders feared for their lives during the battle and fled at first chance. The treaty holds...for now.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgAll07md">The whole world now knows your true brilliance as a commander. Your image is appearing on stamps in every nation across the globe, and a worldwide holiday has been declared in your honor.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgAll07md">The world will never know just how close it came to complete destruction. Let's hope we got every last one of Yuri's clones.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov01md">You have destroyed the Psychic Dominator before Yuri could react. Yuri does not yet realize our plans.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov01md">The Psychic Dominator has been destroyed...but Yuri is now aware of our plans.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov03md">The Psychic Dominator has been destroyed and the Allies believe we fought for a common good. Fools.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov03md">This Psychic Dominator has been neutralized, but I doubt the Allies will ever help us again.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov05md">Your swift attack will keep this secret island a secret forever. Yuri's forces are in full retreat. Press on, General--Defeat Yuri!</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgSov05md">Yuri's submarines are no longer a threat, but your lengthy siege has given Yuri ample time to form another devious plan.</v>

  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgSov07md">The sheer ferocity of your attack and genius of your tactics left Yuri stunned. There is no doubt you have crushed him once and for all.</v>

  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRA2">Under your slow tactics, Yuri gave up the fierce attack on you, and at the same time he has fully obtained the experimental data of the chronosphere.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA2">Your swift offense and wise strategy destroyed Yuri before he could fully prepare to test the teleporter. Perhaps the President will reward you again.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA1">Your rank is: Corporal</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA1U">Your rank is: First Soldier</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRA1">Although Yuri was eventually repelled, the Pacific base was already in ruins.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA1">Your decisive tactics made Yuri completely evacuated the troops without causing a lot of damage here.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParmsgTRA3">We rescued the president and the city, but unfortunately many military secrets were leaked.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA3">The president was rescued by us before Yuri could interrogate important military information. The citizens of this city have not been brainwashed for too long.</v>

  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRN0X1md">Your rank is: Commando Captain</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRN0Xmd">Although we rescued the Prime Minister before the Tyrannosaurus ate Prime Minister Yuri, the excessive loss of troops and the Prime Minister's long-term fright and fear made you not very well received in Yuri's army.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRN0Xmd">Thanks to your wise and decisive judgment and command, we were able to rescue Prime Minister Yuri in the first place, and the other end of time will be rewritten by us, and Yuri’s power will grow stronger due to this successful operation!</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRA4">What happened? Could it be that the time machine setting is invalid?</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA4">We do not hesitate to sacrifice a lot of personnel to ensure the normal operation of the time machine, and we also look forward to the time machine can really save our future. Work harder, whether the other end of time is a new beginning or end, waiting for you to create it.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA5">Your rank is: Lieutenant</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA5U">Your rank is: Second Lieutenant</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRA5">Getting messed up with the past? It doesn't matter, Commander, as long as you can lead us to the final victory, time is not an issue.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA5">Your performance is really good. Our swift attack gave Yuri's amphibious force no chance to land. Yuri's outpost seemed to decline due to insufficient reserve forces and was finally easily destroyed by us.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA6">Your rank is: Captain</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA6U">Your rank is: Upper Lieutenant</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRA6">The enemy is indeed fierce, but we are not easy to deal with. The long war destroyed the vegetation of the Black Forest in a mess. Well, victory is in sight, I hope you can do better in the next battle.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA6">Your performance is still so outstanding, after many battles, your reputation is very high. The president hopes that you can lead us to completely drive Yuri out of the earth!</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA7">Your rank is: Elite Captain</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA7U">Your rank is: Major</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRA7">Although Yuri's experimental device was destroyed, it does not rule out that Yuri has fully mastered the technology of hyperspace weapons. Fortunately, we destroyed Yuri’s lunar rocket ground station, and Yuri has no ability to take it to space.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA7">Your victory again and again makes Yuri surely look at you with admiration and realize that you are a difficult enemy. We smashed Yuri’s conspiracy once again, Commander, good job!</v>

  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRA8">Your decisive and swift action has made the remaining forces of the Allied and Soviet forces not be able to set off many storms. After the Allied and Soviet forces lose their last leaders, the world will follow in Yuri's footsteps, and you will become a great commander second only to Yuri's deity. Yuri's unification of the world is about to be completed, all thanks to you!</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRA8">The long battle has greatly damaged Yuri's reserve force, and at the same time helped the Allied and the Soviet army's determination to resist. Fortunately, the annihilation of Veradimo and Cavelli, the collapse of the Allied and Soviet forces, the victory of Yuri’s unification of the world is in sight, and you will also be loaded into the annals of history.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA3">Your rank is: Sergeant</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRA3U">Your rank is: Sergeant first class</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRN3">The main obstacles on the moon have been removed. However, this battle has caused too many losses for our elites, and it takes more time and materials to rebuild the moon army. Prime Minister Yuri is hesitating whether to continue appointing you.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRN3">Your keen intuition and changeable tactics made the enemy dizzy. The Soviet army had lost its key position on the moon before it had time to react; and the Allied forces were unable to continue to support the battle on the moon because of the interruption of communication. It's time to rebuild our lunar base, commander!</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:ParTitleTRN5">
  </v>
  <v lbl="GUI:OverParMsgTRN5">The Allied forces in Washington surrendered under your slow war of attrition due to lack of sufficient supplies, and we did not have enough time to test the Allied Light Edge technology. Fortunately, the President of the United States is already in our hands, and Americans dare not act rashly anymore.</v>
  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTRN5">You let the enemy see the horror of Prime Minister Yuri in just a few hours. The allied forces stationed realized that you were a difficult opponent and quickly gave up resistance, and the poor American president has now become us. Puppet.</v>

  <v lbl="GUI:UnderParMsgTrn02">We decisively seized the rocket launch pad before the enemy could understand what had happened, and the Allies did not have enough time to apply for support from the headquarters. Your wisdom and decisiveness have already impressed Prime Minister Yuri.</v>
